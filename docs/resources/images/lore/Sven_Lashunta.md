# Sven Jorgenson

## Background

Sven Jorgenson, born and raised on Absalom Station in the Pact Worlds, hails from a proud line of interstellar seafood merchants. His father, Nils Jorgenson, made his fortune selling the finest crustaceans in the galaxy, from the gigantic crabs of Castrovell to exotic shellfish from distant worlds. His most fierce competition has always been the lobster traders from the aquatic planet of Aballon.

Sven has a kind heart and amiable nature, often willing to lend a hand wherever he can. Standing at 5’9”, he carries his heavyset frame with a jovial charm. His bright, blonde hair cascades down to his shoulders, and his face is often dotted with the common signs of youth – pimples and freckles. His blue eyes, a stark contrast to his ruddy complexion, reflect a genuine enthusiasm for life and its experiences.

His friendly demeanor, however, belies his deep-seated insecurities about his appearance. Sven, being overweight and spotty, often feels out of place among the lean and rugged adventurers who typically populate the Invitational. However, he's determined to make his own mark on this challenging event.

## Current Role

Now in his early twenties, Sven is interning with the Invitational support team. His assignment: operating an auxiliary drone that provides camera coverage for the event, offers first-line technical support, and searches for artifacts. Even though it's not the most glamorous job, Sven loves the work. It combines his passion for advanced technology, ancient artifacts, and the thrill of exploration.

Moreover, it's Sven's job to make sure that the audience back home in the Pact Worlds gets a good show. He's the unsung hero behind those stunning aerial shots and the dramatic artifact discoveries. All this work is part of Sven's goal of proving that you don't have to be an adventurer to have a real impact on the Invitational.

## Relationship with His Father

Nils, Sven's father, is also at the Invitational, but not as a proud parent. Instead, he's there to court wealthy clients and to undercut the Aballonians' lobster market. Despite this, Sven hopes to make his father proud. He wants to show Nils that his passion for technology and exploration is just as valuable as a knack for seafood trading.

## Personality

Beneath his friendly exterior, Sven is a determined individual. He has a knack for thinking on his feet, often coming up with unique solutions to the problems that arise during the Invitational. When the pressure is on, Sven doesn't fold; he excels. His tenacity is his strongest quality, and it has earned him the respect of his peers.

All in all, Sven is much more than just an intern; he's an integral part of the Invitational team. He's proof that even in the midst of interstellar adventures, every person has a crucial role to play.
