A Ysoki and 4 AI Battledroids from the Tosnap & lillysponge Corporatation.  
They are hoping to dispell the rumours that their poor AI programming (never legally proven in court) leads to strange decisions in high stakes situations.  
Keep an eye out for any capturs, these Battledroids were build for aggresive enemy retrieval and mid-term containment

Well, someone's been reading the rules! It seems these Team Bio writers are assigned to the teams, and therefor not protected by the rules of collateral damage.  

As i look upon the corpse of this previous teams writer, i can safely say that this team is great. and i'm really happy, and in no way do they come across in anyway other than a happy bright fluffy team..
