![thing](../../../resources/images/teams/battledroids/icon_battledroids.png){ width="200" align=left }

4 AI Battledroids from the Tosnap & lillysponge Corporatation.  

They hope to dispell the incorrect and harmful rumours that early models have an AI programming bug that causes far fetched reasoning to justify immoral actions as ethical.  

Helping to disprove these rumours is their 5th member, Secret, a Ysoki who lives happily locked inside a cage deep within the prisoner containment hold of TLC 1635.

Well, someone's been reading the rules! It seems these Team Bio writers are assigned to the teams, and therefor not protected by the rules of collateral damage.  

As i look upon the corpse of this previous teams writer, i can safely say that this team is great. and i'm really happy, and in no way do they come across in anyway other than a happy bright fluffy team.

Inexperience doesn't stand in the way of entering this Invitational! although likely stands in the way of winning.  
Our Charity team even come dressed in comical gear, with only a sword, knife, and pistol between them!

King Dumum will generously give all profits from placed bets on Caviar Blasters to the Cartusian System Historical and Religious Trust; so consider placing an addtional bet for our early leavers!
